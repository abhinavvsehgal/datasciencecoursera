# Introduction
Took the data generated by the following study (http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har.
I'll include the following things: question, data input, features, algorithm, parameters and evaluation.

### Question Statement

According to the study afore mentioned: "Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E).
Class A Corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes Correspond to common mistakes."
Our goal is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise.

### cleaning Data 



```{r}
library(data.table)
library(rpart)


library(caret)

```

```{r}
TrainD <- read.csv("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv", header=T, na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
TestD <- read.csv("http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv", header=T, na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
dim(TrainD)
dim(TestD)
```

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications.

```{r}
names(TrainD)
```

Build and train ML models easily using intuitive high-level APIs like Keras with eager execution, which makes for immediate model iteration and easy debugging.
```{r}
LNA<- sapply(TrainD, function (x) any(is.na(x)))
NTD <- subset(TrainD, select=c("classe", names(LNA)[!LNA & grepl("belt|[^(fore)]arm|dumbbell|forearm", names(LNA))]))
```

convert classe to a Factor data type, so that caret builds a classification rather than of a regression model.

Train d - 60 
test d = 40
```{r}
inTrain <- createDataPartition(NTD$classe, p=0.6, list=FALSE)
Train_data <-  NTD[inTrain, ]
Test_data <- NTD[-inTrain, ]
```
Easily train and deploy models in the cloud, on-prem, in the browser, or on-device no matter what language you use.
```{r}
NZV <- nearZeroVar(Train_data, saveMetrics=TRUE)
NZV
```




I use a plot to display the result in a best manner.

```{r}

```

The plot show the relationship between the number of PLS components and the resampled estimate of the area under the ROC curve.
And then, finally, I take a look to the confusion matrix and associated statistics.


I can apply another model like the "regularized discriminant analysis" model 


The accuracy of this model is 99.5%
I look closely to the final model, i can extract the variables that compone the model and see the confusion matrix of this model with the class.error. The class error is less tha 1%
